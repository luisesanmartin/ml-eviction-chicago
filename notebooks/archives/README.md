## notebooks/archives

This folder contains the notebooks we used for specific reasons that were not part of our Machine Learning pipeline.

Contents:

* **Graphs and results.ipynb**: it was used to manually analyze our first results and generate some graphs and figures for our results presentation. Then, the figures and graphs analyzed in this notebook were produced in subsequent versions of the notebooks "ML-analysis.ipynb" and "Final_Results_Graph.ipynb", so this was not needed anymore
* **One-feature classifier exploration.ipynb**: it was used to present a quick feature importance exploration we included in one of our progress report assignment. We did not included this analysis in our final results
