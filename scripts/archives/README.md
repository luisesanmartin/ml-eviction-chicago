# scripts/archives

This folder contains scripts previously used in our analysis, but that finally were not part of ML pipeline.

Contents:

* **classifiers.py**: contains an early version of our ML analysis. Its content was replaced by the functions and variables from pipeline.py
* **evaluation.py**: contains an early version of the evaluation of our ML analysis results. Its content was replaced by the functions and variables from pipeline.py
* **preparation.py**: contains an early version of the data preparation we conducted for our ML analysis. Its content was replaced by the functions from feature_gen.py

*Note:* The notebook "One-feature classifier exploration.ipynb" from notebooks/archives uses some functions from these scripts.
